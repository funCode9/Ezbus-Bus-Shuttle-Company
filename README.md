# Ezbus-Bus-Shuttle-Company

As of now, the code files have been lost, but I have the video recorded showing the website I made for a inter-school event held at LOTUS VALLEY INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL, NOIDA. Actually the event was about pitching a business/entreprenurial idea, and I was responsible for building the website for our company.

This static website has 3 to 4 webpages linked, is responsive, clean and modern. 

Built using HTML AND CSS during my 11th class.

The inspiration was taken from a similar bus company, and the assets (images,etc.) used in my website belong to them.
